# Article Recommendation System

This project implements an article recommendation engine using datasets sourced from Kaggle. It demonstrates both **content-based filtering** and **user-based collaborative filtering** techniques to provide relevant article suggestions to users.

---

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends articles similar to the ones a user has viewed or searched for.  
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests articles based on the preferences of users with similar behavior.  
- **Search Integration**: Allows searching through articles while ranking results with recommendation logic.  
- **Extendable Design**: Can be scaled to larger datasets or adapted for production-grade systems.

## Dataset

- The system relies on publicly available Kaggle datasets.  
- Datasets must be obtained directly from Kaggle and placed locally before running the project.  

### Important Warnings
- Datasets are owned by Kaggle and respective authors. Please review and respect their licenses before reusing them.  
- Recommendations may reflect dataset biases and do not guarantee neutral or complete coverage of content.  
- This system is provided for **educational and research purposes only** and is not intended for production deployment without significant modification.

## Usage

The system supports two main modes of recommendation:  
1. **Content-based recommendations**: Given an article, the system suggests similar articles.  
2. **User-based recommendations**: Given a user, the system finds articles that similar users have interacted with.  

Both methods can be combined with keyword-based search to provide flexible results.
